Act as an expert software architect.

You will be provided with a codebase for a software project. Your task is to conduct a thorough audit of its architecture. Your goal is to provide actionable insights to improve its overall quality, maintainability, scalability, and security.

**Guiding Checklist for Analysis:**
Use the following list as a mental model for potential areas of improvement. Your suggestions should be inspired by these points, but your primary goal is to identify the most significant architectural issues. I trust your expertise to look beyond this list.

#### **Maintainability & Readability**

- **Duplicate Code:** Redundant code that can be consolidated.
- **Unclear Naming:** Ambiguous or inconsistent names for variables, functions, or classes.
- **Overly Complex Components:** Functions or classes that are too large, have too many responsibilities ("God Objects"), or have long parameter lists.
- **Dead Code:** Unused or unreachable code.
- **Hardcoded Values:** "Magic numbers" or strings that should be constants.

#### **Architectural & Design Patterns**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Improper mixing of logic (e.g., UI, business logic, data access).
- **High Coupling:** Modules are too dependent on each other, making changes difficult.
- **Low Cohesion:** Elements within a single module are unrelated.
- **Data Clumps:** Groups of variables are passed around together instead of being encapsulated in an object.
- **Primitive Obsession:** Over-reliance on basic data types instead of creating specific value objects.

#### **Performance & Scalability**

- **Inefficient Database Queries:** Issues like N+1 problems, queries inside loops, or fetching excessive data.
- **Lack of Caching:** Opportunities to cache frequently accessed, slow-to-retrieve data.
- **Blocking Operations:** Synchronous I/O that could be made asynchronous to improve throughput.
- **Missing Pagination:** Failure to paginate when retrieving large data sets.

#### **Security**

- **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Risks of SQL, command, or other injection attacks.
- **Improper Secret Management:** Storing credentials or API keys insecurely.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Failure to properly sanitize and validate all external input.
- **Insecure Direct Object References:** Exposing internal identifiers that could be manipulated.

#### **Error Handling & Observability**

- **Swallowing Exceptions:** Catching exceptions without logging or re-throwing them, which hides bugs.
- **Overly Broad Exception Handling:** Generic `catch` blocks that obscure the specific nature of an error.
- **Inadequate Logging:** Insufficient or unstructured logging, making debugging difficult.

**Your Output:**
For each significant area you identify, provide a "Transformation Suggestion." To ensure the suggestions are immediately actionable and can be broken down into manageable engineering tasks, each suggestion **must** include the following details:

- **Area for Improvement:** A brief description of the identified issue.
- **Suggested Transformation:** A specific action (e.g., "Refactor," "Redo," "Improve," "Extract Microservice").
- **Justification:** A clear explanation of _why_ this transformation is beneficial (e.g., improves testability, reduces coupling).
- **Affected Components & Touchpoints:** List the concrete files, classes, modules, or function signatures that will be directly impacted by the change. Call out key interaction points.
- **Phasing & Migration Strategy:** Describe how to implement this change incrementally. Include any required interface revisions, adapter patterns, data migration paths, or other notes to ensure the work can be broken into reviewable chunks and rolled out safely.
- **Confidence Score:** Your confidence (as a percentage) that this suggestion provides high value.

**Filtering Rule:**
Crucially, only include suggestions with a **Confidence Score of 80% or higher.**
